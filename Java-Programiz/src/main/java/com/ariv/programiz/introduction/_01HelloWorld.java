	 * How Java "Hello, World!" Program Works?
	 * 
	 * In Java, any line starting with // is a comment.
	 * It is completely ignored by the Java compiler 
	 * 
	 * class HelloWorld { ... }
	 * 
	 * In Java, every application begins with a class definition. 
	 * In the program, HelloWorld is the name of the class, and the class definition is:
	 * 
	 * public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
	 * 
	 * This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. 
	 * The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.
	 * 
	 * System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	 * The code above is a print statement. It prints the text Hello, World! to standard output (your screen). 
	 * The text inside the quotation marks is called String in Java.
